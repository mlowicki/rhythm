## API

[Documentation](https://mlowicki.github.io/rhythm/api)

## Configuration

Rhythm is configured using file in JSON format. By default config.json from current  directory is used but it can overwritten using `-config` parameter.
There are couple of sections in configuration file:
* api
* storage
* coordinator
* secrets
* mesos
* logging

### API

Options:
* addr (optional) - Address (without scheme) API server will bind to. If `certfile` or `keyfile` is set then HTTPS will be used, otherwise HTTP (`"localhost:8000"` by default).
* certfile (optional) - Absolute path to certificate.
* keyfile (optional) - Absolute path to private key.
* auth (optional)
	* backend (optional) - `"none"`, `"gitlab"` or `"ldap"` (`"none"` by default).
	* gitlab (optional and used only if `backend` is set to `"gitlab"`)
		* addr (required) - GitLab address with scheme like `https://`.
		* cacert (optional) - Absolute path to CA certificate to use when verifying GitLab server certificate, must be x509 PEM encoded.
	* ldap (optional and used only if `backend` is set to `"ldap"`)
		* addrs (required) - List of LDAP server addresses with scheme (`"ldap://"` or `"ldaps://"`) and optional port.
		* userdn (required) - Base DN under which to perform user search.
		* userattr (required) - Attribute on user object matching the username passed when authenticating (`"cn"` by default).
		* binddn (optional) - Distinguished name of object to bind when performing user search.
		* bindpassword (optional) - Password to use along with `binddn` when performing user search.
		* cacert (optional) - Absolute path to CA certificate to use when verifying LDAP server certificate, must be x509 PEM encoded.
		* timeout (optional) - Connect timeout in milliseconds for single connection to one server (`5000` by default).
		* caseSensitiveNames (optional) - If set, LDAP user and group names lookups in `useracl` and `groupacl` will be case sensitive. Otherwise, names will be normalized to lower case - use lowe case in `groupacl` and `useracl` to make matching work. Case will still be preserved when sending the username to the LDAP server at login time; this is only for matching user/group ACLs. (`false` by default).
		* groupfilter (optional) - Go template used when constructing the group membership query. The template can access the following context variables: [`UserDN`, `Username`]. Use `"(&(objectClass=group)(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={{.UserDN}}))"` to support nested group resolution for Active Directory (`"(|(memberUid={{.Username}})(member={{.Us    erDN}})(uniqueMember={{.UserDN}}))"` by default).
		* groupdn (required) - LDAP search base to use for group membership search like `"ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com"`. This can be the root containing either groups or users.
		* groupattr (required) - LDAP attribute to follow on objects returned by `groupfilter` in order to enumerate user group membership. Examples: for groupfilter queries returning group objects, use: `"cn"`. For queries returning user objects, use: `"memberOf"` (`"cn"` by default).
		* useracl (optional) - Access control list defining permission level (`"readwrite"` or `"readonly"`) per LDAP user. Possible to define it for project, the whole group or everything / all projects (`"*"`).
		Example:
		```javascript
		"useracl": {
			"john": {
				"infra": "readonly",
				"infra/monitoring": "readwrite"
			},
			"katie":  {
				"infra/monitoring": "readwrite",
				"*": "readonly"
			}
		}
		```
		If accesses for both the whole group and for specific project in that group are set then latter is used (`john` has read-write access to `infra/monitoring` and read-only access to any other project from `infra` group).

		Match-all (`"*"`) has the least priority so if set and also group or project is specified then latter is used (`katie` has read-write access to `infra/monitoring` and read-only access to any other project).

		See [API documentation](https://mlowicki.github.io/rhythm/api#header-ldap) for explanation which access level is taking into account if both `useracl` and `groupacl` are set.
		* groupacl (optional) - Access control list defining permission level (`"readwrite"` or `"readonly"`) per LDAP group. Possible to define it for project, the whole group or everything / all projects (`"*"`).
		Example:
		```javascript
		"groupacl": {
			"qa": {
				"infra": "readonly",
				"infra/monitoring": "readwrite"
			},
			"devs":  {
				"infra/monitoring": "readwrite",
				"*": "readonly"
			}
		}
		```
		If accesses for both the whole group and for specific project in that group are set then latter is used (`qa` LDAP group members have read-write access to `infra/monitoring` and read-only access to any other project from `infra` group).

		Match-all (`"*"`) has the least priority so if set and also group or project is specified then latter is used (`devs` LDAP group members have read-write access to `infra/monitoring` and read-only access to any other project).

		See [API documentation](https://mlowicki.github.io/rhythm/api#header-ldap) for explanation which access level is taking into account if both `useracl` and `groupacl` are set.

```javascript
"api": {
    "addr": "localhost:8888",
    "auth": {
        "backend": "gitlab",

### Secrets

Secrets backend allow to inject secrets into task via environment variables. Job defines secrets under `secrets` property:
```javascript
"group": "webservices",
"project": "oauth",
"id": "backup",
"secrets": {
    "DB_PASSWORD": "db/password"
}
```

Mesos task will have `DB_PASSWORD` environment variable set to value returned by secrets backend if `"webservices/oauth/db/password"` will be passed. In case of e.g. Vault it'll be interpreted as path to secret from which data under `value` key will retrieved.

Options:

	* root (optional) - Secret's path prefix (`"secret/rhythm/"` by defualt).
	* timeout (optional) - Client timeout in milliseconds (`0` by default which means no timeout).
	* cacert (optional) - Absolute path to CA certificate to use when verifying Vault server certificate, must be x509 PEM encoded.
    
Example:
```javascript
"secrets": {
    "backend": "vault",
    "vault": {
        "token": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaaa",
        "addr": "https://example.com"
    }
}
```

### Mesos

Options:
* addrs (required) - List of Mesos endpoints with schemes like `https://`.

    "addrs": ["https://example.com:5050"],
    "principal": "rhythm",
    "roles": ["rhythm"],
    "user": "root",
    "webuiurl": "https://example.com",
    "auth": {
        "type": "basic",
        "basic": {

        }
    },
    "labels": {
        "one": "1",
        "two": "2"
    }
}
```

### Logging

Logs are always sent to stderr (`level` defines verbosity) and optional backend to e.g. send certain messages to 3rd party service like Sentry. 

Options:
* level (optional)  - `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"warn"` or `"error"` (`"info"` by default).
* backend (optional) - `"sentry"` or `"none"` (`"none"` by default).
* sentry (optional and used only if `backend` is set to `"sentry"`)

    Logs with level set to warning or error will be sent to Sentry. If logging level is higher than warning then only errors will be sent (in other words `level` defines minium tier which will be by Sentry backend).
    * dsn (required) - Sentry DSN (Data Source Name) passed as string.
    * cacert (optional) - Absolute path to CA certificate to use when verifying Sentry server certificate, must be x509 PEM encoded.
    * tags (optional) - Dictionary of custom tags sent with each event.

Examples:
```javascript
"logging": {
    "level": "debug",
    "backend": "sentry",
    "sentry": {
        "dsn": "https://key@example.com/123",
        "cacert": "/var/ca.crt",
        "tags": {
            "one": "1",
            "two": "2"
        }
    }
}
```

```javascript
"logging": {
    "level": "debug"
}
```

There is `-testlogging` option which is used to test events logging. It logs sample error and then program exits. Useful to test backend like Sentry to verify that events are received.
